# AirbnbScrapeAndSearcher

*work in progress*

This program runs an Airbnb search and returns what page your listing lands on. Additionally, it scrapes data about your listing and all other listings found in the search, and writes this data to both a .csv and .txt file

```console
python3 main.py --location=<my-location> --checkin=2023-05-09 --checkout=2023-05-11 --adults=10 --children=0 --infants=0 --pets=0
